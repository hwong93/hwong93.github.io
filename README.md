#PORTFOLIO

This is my portfolio page. My main goal when making this page was to improve my front-end development skills without using a framework like bourbon. I tried to make this portfolio as original as possible.

There are still many things I would like to add/try out in this page:

1. More web responsive.
2. More animations(have a header that would constantly display projects I'm working on at the moment)
3. Add a contact form.
4. Still debating on adding Job Experience since for now, none of my job experience relates to Web Development.
